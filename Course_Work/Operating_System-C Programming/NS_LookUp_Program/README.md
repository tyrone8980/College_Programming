### Description: 

The purpose of this project is to create my own ns look up function instead the nslookup command(which has its restrictions).
Included are the final and instruction C program files . 
The program asks for a DNS to send a packet to, sends the packet, waits for a response,
and then after receiving the response, re-arranges the bitmapping of the response, so we can read the response from the packet. 




### Program Execution Details 
```
1. Compile and Execute final.C
2. Execute final.c 
3. Enter a website's address
4. Read the packet response
```
