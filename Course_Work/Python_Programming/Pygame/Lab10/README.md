# Lab 10 User Control 

Your assignment:
This lab gives you a chance to practice drawing an object with a function, and allowing the user to control it.

Create one program that has the following:

* Create at least two different functions that draw an object to the screen. For example, draw_bird and draw_tree. 
  Do not draw a stick figure, we did that one already. Create your own unique item. Do not simply draw a circle or rectangle.
  That's boring. Draw a train, or cloud, or house, T-Rex or whatever. But minimal work = minimal points. 
  If you created your own object in the create-a-picture lab feel free to adapt it to this lab.
* In Chapter 10, we talked about moving graphics with the keyboard, a game controller, and the mouse. 
  Pick two of those and use them to control two different items on the screen.
* In the case of the game controller and the keyboard, make sure to add checks so that your object does not move off-screen and get lost. 
  Remember the worksheet 10 question, don't just reverse the direction like the bouncing rectangle.
