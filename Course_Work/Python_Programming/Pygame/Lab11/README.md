# Lab 11 Bitmapped Graphics and User Control 

Your assignment: Create a graphics based program. You can start a new program, or continue with a prior lab.

This is the checklist for completing this lab:

* Make sure this program is created in its own directory. 
  If you are starting from the template I have at BitBucket, then make sure you start in the 
  “Lab 11 - Bitmapped Graphics and User Control” folder and put everything in there.
* Incorporate at least one function that draws an item on the screen. 
  The function should take position data that specifies where to draw the item. 
* Add the ability to control an item via mouse, keyboard, or game controller.
* Include some kind of bit-mapped graphics. Do not include bit-mapped graphics as part of your “draw with a function.” 
* Include sound. You could make a sound when the user clicks the mouse, hits a key, moves to a certain location, etc. If the sound is problematic, try using the program Audacity to load the sound, and then export it as a .ogg file.
