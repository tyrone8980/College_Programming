# Lab 12 Classes and Graphics

Your assignment: 
Graphics provide an excellent opportunity to use classes. 
Each graphic object can be represented by an object.
Each type of graphic object can be represented by a class. 
An object's location, speed, and color can be stored in attributes.

Develop a program that creates 10,000 different objects, of different size and color, 
then move them around the screen. 
It should look like shapes gone crazy!!!!
