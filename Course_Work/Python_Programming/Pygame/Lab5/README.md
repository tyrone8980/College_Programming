# Lab 5 Create a picture

Your assignment: Draw a pretty picture. The goal of this lab is to get practice using functions, using for loops, and introduce computer graphics.

To get full credit:

You must use multiple colors.
You must have a coherent picture. I am not interested in abstract art with random shapes.
You must use multiple types of graphic functions (e.g. circles, rectangles, lines, etc.)
You must use a while or for loop to create a repeating pattern. Do not just redraw the same thing in the same location 10 times.
Actually use that index variable as an offset to displace what you are drawing. 
Remember that you can contain multiple drawing commands in a loop, so you can draw multiple train cars for example.
