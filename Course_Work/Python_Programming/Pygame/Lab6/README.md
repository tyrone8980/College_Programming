# Lab 6 Loopy Lab
Write a Python program that will print the following:
```
10
11 12
13 14 15
16 17 18 19
20 21 22 23 24
25 26 27 28 29 30
31 32 33 34 35 36 37
38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45
46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54
```

6.2 Part 2
Create a big box out of n rows of little o's for any desired size n. 
Use an input statement to allow the user to enter the value for n and then print the properly sized box.

```
E.g. n = 3
oooooo
o    o
oooooo
 
E.g. n = 8
oooooooooooooooo
o              o
o              o
o              o
o              o
o              o
o              o
oooooooooooooooo

```

6.3 Part 3
This part of the lab is difficult. Skip to part 4 if you aren't interested in the challenge.

Print the following for any positive integer n. 
Use an input statement to allow the user to enter the value for n and then print the properly sized box.
```
E.g. n = 3
 
1 3 5 5 3 1
3 5     5 3
5         5
5         5
3 5     5 3
1 3 5 5 3 1
 
E.g. n = 5
1 3 5 7 9 9 7 5 3 1
3 5 7 9     9 7 5 3
5 7 9         9 7 5
7 9             9 7
9                 9
9                 9
7 9             9 7
5 7 9         9 7 5
3 5 7 9     9 7 5 3
1 3 5 7 9 9 7 5 3 1

```

Don't worry about handling the spacing for multi-digit numbers. Chapter 20 covers this if you want to look ahead, but it isn't needed.


6.4 Part 4

Use nested for loops to draw small green rectangles. Make the image look like Figure 27.1.
Do not create the grid by drawing lines, use a grid created by rectangles.
